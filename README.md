# What is this?

This is fake malware designed to scare a user into no longer downloading anything from strangers or even people they know.

# What does it do?

Not much. It throws a few message boxes onto the screen, creates a file with the source code link, and then opens this link in a browser. No damage was done at all.

# Should I send this to people?

Yes! That's the whole purpose of this. Make sure people know how dangerous files can be.
